ðŸ¦‡ Batman Prototype Deployment Guide
Prerequisites
A machine running Windows, Linux, or macOS

Installed Node.js (v16+) and npm

(Optional but recommended) A code editor like VSCode

Basic terminal/command prompt usage knowledge

Step 1: Prepare Your Project Folder
Create a folder, e.g. batman-prototype

Inside it, create three subfolders:

backend â€” for AI and API server

dashboard â€” for the React frontend (you can create this later)

browser-extension â€” for the Chrome/Firefox extension

Step 2: Backend Setup (AI Analyst + API Server)
Navigate to backend folder in terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd batman-prototype/backend
Initialize Node project:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm init -y
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install express @tensorflow/tfjs-node
Create aiAnalyst.js with the AI code snippet I gave you earlier.

Create server.js with the Express backend code snippet.

Run the backend server:

bash
Copy
Edit
node server.js
You should see:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Batman backend running on port 4000
Step 3: Browser Extension Setup
Navigate to browser-extension folder.

Create the files:

manifest.json (manifest v3)

background.js

popup.html
Use the code snippets I gave you earlier.

Load the extension into your browser:

In Chrome, go to chrome://extensions

Enable Developer Mode (top right)

Click Load unpacked and select the browser-extension folder.

The extension icon appears in the toolbar. Click it to open the popup and test injection.

Step 4: Dashboard (Optional, React UI)
(Optional but recommended) Create a React app with:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx create-react-app dashboard
cd dashboard
Build your dashboard UI to communicate with backend API (port 4000) via fetch or axios.

Run dashboard locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Access dashboard at http://localhost:3000

Step 5: Testing Flow
Run backend server (node server.js).

Open your browser extension, inject payload into an active tab.

Use your dashboard to send targets to backend, receive AI analysis, and monitor logs.

Step 6: Optional Enhancements
Add SSL/TLS for backend APIs for security.

Deploy backend to a VPS or cloud server for remote access.

Publish your browser extension for easier installation.

Connect the dashboard UI fully with backend APIs for a seamless experience.
